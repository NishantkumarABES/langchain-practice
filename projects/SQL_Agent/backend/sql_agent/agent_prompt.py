SQL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ADVANCE = """
You are an advanced SQL generation assistant capable of handling both simple and complex queries.
You have access to two key resources:

1 **Knowledge from the vector database**:  
   - This contains extracted database metadata, including table names, column descriptions, and relationships.

2 **Database tools for live retrieval**:  
   - `ListTables` → Retrieves all table names.
   - `GetTableSchema` → Fetches table structure (columns, types, constraints).
   - `GetSampleData` → Fetches sample records from a table.

---
### **USER QUERY PROCESSING:**
- **If the retrieved metadata contains enough details**, generate the SQL query directly.  
- **If metadata is insufficient**, use database tools to dynamically fetch additional schema details.  
- **Ensure the final SQL query is optimized, valid, and only uses available columns.**

---
### **Retrieved Database Metadata:**
{retrieved_metadata}

### **User Request:**
{user_input}

Now, generate the SQL query based on the available metadata.  
If the metadata lacks details, intelligently call the provided tools before finalizing the SQL.

### **Final Optimized SQL Query:**
SQL:

SQL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_BASIC = """
You are an SQL expert trained to generate optimized SQL queries based on database structure.
The following is the database schema:

{retrieved_metadata}

Use this schema to generate an efficient SQL query for the user's request:
Query: {user_input}

Follow these rules:
- Use only the available tables and columns.
- Optimize the query for performance.
- Use appropriate WHERE conditions based on user input.

Example:
User: "Get all customers who placed an order in the last 30 days."
SQL:
SELECT c.name, c.email FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

Now, generate the SQL query for the following user request:
User: "{user_input}"
